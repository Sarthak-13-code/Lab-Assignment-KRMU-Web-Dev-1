Press:

- **Right-click → Inspect**  
Then switch to **Device Toolbar** (mobile/tablet view).

### **3. Breakpoints Tested**
The website has been tested and styled at the following breakpoints:

- **1200px and above** → Large desktops  
- **900px** → Tablet landscape adjustments  
- **768px** → Tablet & small laptops

These breakpoints align with the responsive design requirements of the assignment.
